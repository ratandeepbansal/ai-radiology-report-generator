## 🚀 Ready for Week 2

The foundation is solid and ready for Week 2 tasks:

### Week 2 Goals
1. **Vision Model Integration**
   - Install and test BLIP-2 model
   - Implement image captioning
   - Create vision.py module

2. **LLM Integration**
   - Set up OpenAI API
   - Create llm_processor.py module
   - Test GPT-4o-mini integration

3. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Design report generation prompts
   - Test prompt variations
   - Optimize for medical context

4. **Pipeline Integration**
   - Connect: Image → Vision Model → LLM → Report
   - Measure latency and quality
   - Create logging system

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Before Starting Week 2

1. **Get API Keys** (if not done)
   - OpenAI API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Add credits to account (~$5-10 recommended)
   - Update .env file

2. **Download Real Datasets** (optional but recommended)
   - Kaggle Chest X-Ray: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
   - Place in data/raw/ for realistic testing

3. **Review Configuration**
   - Check config.py settings
   - Verify model names
   - Adjust parameters if needed

### Week 2 Tasks Priority
1. Vision model setup (BLIP-2)
2. LLM processor (OpenAI API)
3. Basic prompt template
4. First end-to-end test: image → report

## 💡 Notes & Observations

### What Went Well
- Clean modular design
- Comprehensive error handling
- Well-documented code
- Extensive testing
- Flexible configuration

### Considerations for Week 2
- API costs: Monitor OpenAI usage
- Model size: BLIP-2 may need GPU (or use CPU with patience)
- Prompt engineering: Will require iteration
- Latency: Track processing time at each stage

### Optional Improvements (if time permits)
- Add more test images with variety
- Create Jupyter notebook for visualization
- Add more report templates
- Implement data augmentation
