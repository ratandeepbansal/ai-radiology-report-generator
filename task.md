## üìù Notes & Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Get basic image ‚Üí text ‚Üí report working first, then add complexity
2. **Test Iteratively:** Test each component independently before integration
3. **Document Early:** Write docs as you code, not at the end
4. **Version Control:** Commit frequently with clear messages
5. **Ask for Help:** Engage with communities (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow)
6. **Stay Organized:** Use project management tools (Trello, Notion, GitHub Projects)
7. **Manage Scope:** Focus on MVP first, add bonus features if time permits
8. **API Costs:** Monitor OpenAI API usage to avoid unexpected charges
9. **Medical Accuracy:** Disclaimer that this is educational/research only, not for clinical use
10. **Enjoy the Process:** This is a learning journey - embrace challenges!
